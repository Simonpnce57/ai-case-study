# CRISPR and AI: Revolutionizing Gene Editing

## Overview and Origin

* **Name of company**: CRISPR Therapeutics AG
* **When was the company incorporated?**: 2013¹⁷
* **Who are the founders of the company?**: Emmanuelle Charpentier, Shaun Foy, and Rodger Novak¹⁷
* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**: The idea stemmed from the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 as a gene-editing tool by Emmanuelle Charpentier and others, which has the potential to treat genetic diseases¹⁷.
* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**: CRISPR Therapeutics has raised a total of $407M in funding over 6 rounds³.

## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**: CRISPR Therapeutics aims to develop gene-based medicines for serious diseases using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology⁸.
* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**: Their intended customers are patients with genetic disorders, with a market size that could reach $17.8 billion by 2034²³.
* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**: CRISPR Therapeutics offers the first-ever approved CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy³⁵.
* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**: They use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology and have developed a platform for translating this into therapies⁸.

## Landscape

* **What field is the company in?**: Biotechnology and gene editing⁸.
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?**: The major trend has been the development and refinement of CRISPR as a precise gene-editing tool⁶. Also, the incorporation of ML tools to analyze large sets of Genome data, this information can then be applied to tasks such as the creation of totally new sequences. 
* **What are the other major companies in this field?**: Competitors include Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and others³².

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**: CRISPR Therapeutics has made significant strides in gene therapy, with the first-ever approval of a CRISPR-based therapy³⁵.
* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?**: Success metrics include the number of people treated, the efficacy of treatments, and the advancement of clinical trials¹¹.
* **How is your company performing based on these metrics?**: CRISPR Therapeutics has successfully brought a CRISPR-based therapy to market and continues to advance its clinical trials³⁵.
* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**: CRISPR Therapeutics is among the leaders in the field, with one of the first approved therapies³⁵.  The second describes a new generation of all-star CRISPR-Cas9 proteins the team evolved that are capable of targeting a much larger fraction of pathogenic mutations, including the one responsible for sickle cell anemia, which was prohibitively difficult to access with previous CRISPR methods.


## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**: Expand into personalized CRISPR-based therapies for a wider range of genetic conditions.
* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**: Personalized medicine is the future of healthcare, and being at the forefront could position the company as a market leader.
* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**: Scientists have used artificial intelligence (AI) to create new CRISPR gene-editing tools. The AI algorithms were trained on vast amounts of biological data, allowing researchers to design new CRISPR proteins and RNA molecules. The resulting gene editors (CRISPR-Cas9, ProGen, OpenCRISPR-1 and EVO) were able to precisely cut their intended targets in the genome, and some of them showed promise as efficient and precise gene-editing tools. The work has the potential to accelerate the development of new gene therapies and other medical treatments. The great majority of AI systems, such as CRISPR-Cas9, show much potential but are not peer-reviewed.

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**: AI can enhance the precision and efficacy of CRISPR gene editing, leading to better patient outcomes and broader applicability of therapies.\
